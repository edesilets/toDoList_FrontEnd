# To Do List Frontend

## For testing

| id |      User Name      | password |
| -- | ------------------- | ---------|
| 7  | jacob@statefarm.com | password |
| 6  | frank@statefarm.com | password |
| 5  | jess@statefarm.com  | password |

## What does it do?

This is a To do list keeper. I keeps track of what needs to be completed.

## How it work?

User logs in an can access preiously made lists and create, add, delete and update items.

## Construction apporach
My method to construct this product was to complete my backend then work on the
front end.

## Unsolved problems

1. On Refresh the list gets placed in a "random order". (solution: have rails sort assending or descending)
2. When one user logs out and doesn't refresh the page the next one to login has a broken page.
3. buttons don't toggle to user flow options for login
4. Why glyphicons render localy but not when deployed.

#### User stories

* ONLY after signin will user be able to see page contents.
* User will be able to view a list by clicking drop down.
* User will then be able to see the items in there list.

* User will be able to delete an item/s by checking buttons on side of items (button for submit/confirm action)
* User will be able to create a new list by selecting 'new list' from dropdown and then populateing field and click 'add list'
* User will be able to delete list and all items by one click of button on side of listname.
